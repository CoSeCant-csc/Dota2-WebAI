# Dota2-WebAI

### What is this
This will be my attempt at writing Dota 2 bots using a webserver backend that 
will provide all the decision making logic for the bots. The bots will then
be instructed what they are supposed to be doing at the *macro*-level, and 
know how to execute those instructions inside the Dota 2 world through the 
exposed Bot-Scripting API.

### How to run
Run the *local_server.py* file provided (Python 2.7+)
[Then follow these directions](https://github.com/Nostrademous/Dota2-FullOverwrite/wiki/Workflow-for-Debugging-Bots)
